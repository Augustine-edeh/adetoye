          I specialize in creating front-end web applications using HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript. I'm also well-versed with TailwindCSS and the React JS
          framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          I create websites for a variety of purposes, and I always optimize for
          the best possible user experience.

          Before switching to a professional career, I started programming as a
          hobby, creating a variety of fun projects, this has made it very easy
          for me to solve challenging tasks because I always find an interesting
          way to break it down into smaller tasks while having fun. I also enjoy
          learning and I aspire to work in an environment that allows me learn
          and continuously improve my skills.
