        <p>
          I'm a full-stack developer, with a soft spot for the front end. In
          simple terms, I transform business problems into neat code solutions,
          one line at a time. Over the past three years, I've been putting this
          into practice, working with all kinds of remote teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          My toolkit includes but is not limited to, React, Typescript, NodeJs,
          ExpressJs, MySQL REST APIs, Nextjs, JavaScript, and MongoDB. I love
          expanding my knowledge and skill set by learning about new
          technologies as they come along.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spend most of my free time on volunteer work and open-source
          projects, expanding my knowledge base and fueling my passion for
          software solutions.
        </p>
